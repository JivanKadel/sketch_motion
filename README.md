# SketchMotion

# ---UNDER DEVELOPMENT---

**SketchMotion** is a modern drawing and sketching app, **currently under active development**. It empowers users to create, animate, and export sketches with ease, leveraging the latest web technologies.

---

## Features

- **Draw Shapes:** Line, arrow, rectangle, oval, and circle tools.

- **Freehand Drawing:** Smooth your strokes using the [Douglas-Peucker Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramerâ€“Douglasâ€“Peucker_algorithm).

- **Add Text & Images:** Insert and position text or images on your canvas.

- **Select & Move:** Easily select and reposition objects.

- **Transformations:** Rotate, scale, and skew objects _(under development)_.

- **Frames & Animation:** Add frames, adjust frame rates, and preview frame-by-frame animations.

- **Export Options:** Save your work as SVG, PNG, Webm, and mp4.
